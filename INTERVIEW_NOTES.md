### Interview-Related Project Notes:

#### Overview
This project was created as a way of exploring python-driven web developmentusing Test-Driven-Development methodologies.

* __Primary Technologies:__ Python 3, Git, GitHub

* __Frameworks & Libraries:__ Django, Selenium (for TDD), GeckoDriver (for functional testing of Firefox)

* __Concepts:__ Test-Driven-Development (TDD), Functional Testing (FT), Agile Development, Version Control, Web Development


#### Explanation of How Concepts Were Involved

##### Functional Testing

Functional tests were generated in order to test the app, from initally writing comments to form the 'user story' for the test, to actually writing tests before developing features.


##### Agile Development

Even though there was no client for this project, so there were no iterations of features, etc., an agile-like mindset was used from the standpoint of developing the 'minimum viable app' and branching out from there.

In this sense, this to-do list app started by generating functionality to (1) let the user enter some item; and (2) remember the list so it could be presented back to the user at a later visit.
